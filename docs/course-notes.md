# 1.Data Engineering Fundamentals
Types of data:
* structured
* Unstructured
* semi structured

Properties of data:
* volumn
* velocity 
* variety

## Data Warehouse Vs Lake
Data Warehouse: Centralized repo for analysis, stored in structured format
Data Lake: Vast amount of raw data, any type. e.g. Simple Storage service s3, hdfs

Schema: schema on write (warehouse etl), schema on read (lak elt)
agility: lake > warehouse
cost: warehouse > lake

lakehouse: combination on 2 (aws lake formation)

## Data Mesh
* data management paradigm

Data sources:
* jdbc (java database connectivity)
* odbc (open database connectivity)
* raw logs
* apis


Formats: csv, json, avro, parquet

Data modeling:
##Â star schema:
* fact tables
* dimensions tables
* primary keys linking

## sql
aggregation:
* COUNT
* SUM
* AVG
* MAX/MIN

e.g. 
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
```

* aggregate with case: WHERE, CASE WHEN

* grouping: GROUP BY 

* pivoting: PIVOT ()


* ~: reqular expression operator
* ~*: case insensitive
* !~*: not ...

# 2.Storage

* Amazon s3 stands for Simple Storage Service

## S3 bucket policy
* user-based vs resource based (IAM vs bucket policies, acl)
* Examples:
    * User access to s3 -> IAM Permissions
    * EC2 instance acesss -> IAM Roles
    * Cross account access -> bucket policy

## S3 Versioning & Replication
* lets you see how files change
* deletion results in delete marker
* versioning required for crr/srr (cross region/same region replication)

## S3 Storage Classes
* Standard - General Purpose
* Standard-Infrequent Access (IA) - disaster recovery, backups
* One Zone-Infrequent Access - secondary backups, data can be created
* Glacier Instant Retrieval - once a quarter, quick acess
* Glacier Flexible Retrieval - takes longer
* Glacier Deep Archive - even longer
* Intelligent Tiering - moves object between intelligent tiering
* express one zone - good for etls/streaming

## S3 Lifecycle rules
* Transition, Expiration actions
* lets you decide what storage classes the objects have over time.

## S3 Event notifications
* events: objects removed, createded, restored, replicated
* s3 event notifications relates to iam permsiions (Resource access policy)
* events can be sent to sqs (simple queue service), sns (simple notification service) or lambda
* events can also be sent to Amazon EventBridge (which can apply rules to 18 other aws services)

hands on
* s3 bucket -> properties -> events and notifications -> create event notification
* sqs -> create queue -> queue policy -> edit access policy -> generate policy for sqs resource to detect object creation events in s3
* s3 -> create event notification with existing sqs queue


## S3 Performance
* per prefix performance
* multipart performance better
* transfer acceleration. (to public local location, privately sends to desired s3 region)
* s3 byte range fetches

## S3 object encryption
* sse (server side encryption) sse-s3, sse-kms (key management service)
* sse-c (client)
* client side encryption - encrypt before sending to s3
* DSSE-KMS "Dual layer server side encryption"

hands on 3 ways:
* Create s3 bucket with versioning on -> upload file -> edit file to use differen encryption -> creates new version of file
* default encryption type of s3 bucket
* When uploading file, there is option to set encryption type

## S3 Access points
* ways of accessing s3 buckets
* simplifies security management for s3 bucket
* each access point has individual dns

## S3 Object Lambda
* Use Lambda to change object before retrieved
* s3 bucket -> supporting s3 access point -> lambda -> s3 object lambda access point -> caller


## S3 Storage lens
* service to analyse, optomise storage access

## EC2 Instance Storage
* EBS (Elastic Block store) volume -> network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
* EBS volume mount to one instance at a time. 
* locked in availabilty zones
* delete on termination attribute -> ebs behaviour when instance terminates

hands on:
* go on ec2 instance -> add/modify ebs volume per instance. 

## EFS (Elastic file system)
* managed nfs that can mount to many instances (ec2)
* expensive (3x gp2 ebs volume)
* multi az
* storage classes:
    * standard
    * infrequent access
    * archive
* lifecycle policies

hands on:
* EFS -> create file system
